fun_igp(
  x,
  r_b = 5,
  k = 100,
  e = c(5, 5, 5),
  a = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{community matrix for basal, intraguild prey (ig-prey), and intraguild predator (ig-predator)}

\item{r_b}{maximum reproductive rate of basal species}

\item{k}{carrying capacity}

\item{e}{energetic conversion efficiency; must be given by the order of basal to ig-prey, basal to ig-predator, and ig-prey to ig-predator}

\item{a}{attack rate; must be given by the order of basal to ig_prey, basal to ig-predator, and ig-prey to ig-predator}

\item{h}{handling time; ; must be given by the order of basal to ig_prey, basal to ig-predator, and ig-prey to ig-predator}

\item{s0}{background survival rate; must be given by the order of basal, ig-prey, and ig-predator}
