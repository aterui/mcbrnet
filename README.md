# Overview

`mcbrnet` is a collection of functions to perform metacommunity
simulation in branching networks. Main functions include:

- `brnet()` generates a random branching network with the specified
  number of patches and probability of branching. The function returns
  adjacency and distance matrices, hypothetical
  environmental/disturbance values at each patch, and the number of
  patches upstream (akin to the watershed area in river networks).

- `mcsim()` simulates metacommunity dynamics. This function follows a
  general framework proposed by [Thompson et
  al.Â (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13568). However, it has
  several unique features that are detailed in [Terui et al
  (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2105574118).

- `igpsim()` simulates three-species meta-food web dynamics with
  intraguild predation. This function shares many features with
  `mcsim()`. Currently under development.

- `ggbrnet()` is a wrapper of `ggraph` functions for easy visualization
  of a network produced by `brnet()` .

- `ptsource()` is a function to simulate propagation of environmental
  pollutants in a river network.

- `frgm()` is a function to simulate fragmentation in a river network.

- `adjtodist()` converts an adjacency matrix to a distance matrix.
