# Overview

`mcbrnet` is a collection of functions to perform metacommunity
simulation in branching networks. Main functions include:

-   `brnet()` generates a random branching network with the specified
    number of patches and probability of branching. The function returns
    adjacency and distance matrices, hypothetical
    environmental/disturbance values at each patch, and the number of
    patches upstream (akin to the watershed area in river networks). The
    output may be used in function `mcsim()` to simulate metacommunity
    dynamics in a branching network.

-   `mcsim()` simulates metacommunity dynamics. By default, it produces
    a square-shaped landscape with randomly distributed habitat patches
    (x- and y-coordinates are drawn from a uniform distribution). If a
    distance matrix is given, the function simulates metacommunity
    dynamics in the specified landscape. Function `mcsim()` follows a
    general framework proposed by [Thompson et
    al.Â (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13568). However, it has
    several unique features that are detailed in [Terui et al
    (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2105574118).

-   `igpsim()` simulates three-species meta-food web dynamics with
    intraguild predation. This function shares many features with
    `mcsim()`. Currently under development.

-   `ggbrnet()` is a wrapper of `ggraph` functions for easy
    visualization of a network produced by `brnet()` .

-   `ptsource()` is a function to simulate propagation of environmental
    pollutants in a river network. Produced values may be plugged into
    `q` argument in `mcsim()`.

-   `adjtodist()` converts an adjacency matrix to a distance matrix.
